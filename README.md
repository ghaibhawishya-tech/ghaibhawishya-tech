# Hi, I'm Bhawishya Ghai 👋

### DSAI Student at Masters' Union | Gurugram, India

---

I'm a first-year **Data Science & AI** student at **Masters' Union**. I'm interested in AI, product thinking, and how technology can solve real problems for real people.

Right now I'm learning by building — experimenting with ideas, shipping small projects, and figuring things out as I go. Some of what I've built is rough around the edges, and that's fine. The goal is to keep building.
