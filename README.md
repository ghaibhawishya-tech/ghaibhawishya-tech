## About Me

I'm a first-year **Data Science & AI** student at **Masters' Union**, Gurugram — building real products, not just studying them.

I care deeply about the intersection of **AI engineering**, **product thinking**, and **business impact**. Every project I build starts with a user problem and ends with something deployed.

- Currently working as an **E-commerce Operations Associate** at NEW EXCELLENT TELEVENTURES — driving pricing strategy, SEO, and inventory analytics across 100+ listings
- Built **Priya** — a full-stack RAG chatbot that indexes 100+ scholarships and helps first-gen students navigate higher education
- Built **ProWriteAI** — an LLM-powered writing suite that generates 5+ content types from a single prompt
- Gold Medalist, National Mathematics Olympiad
